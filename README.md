# python-api-challenge

WeatherPy:
The way i approched this challenge was to use the templete given to us by  the professor.
To find the city_url I used assistance from the website api to create the url.
I had some help from the professor to help my "try" loop becuase i was getting an error.
Once my data was appering with no error i was able to create my data frames.
I used previous examples from our last assigment to develop my formulas to plot my graphs. Once i found one i was able to copy and past them but making some small accomidations. 
I used Xper assistance to help me find the formal for the hemispheres.
After that i was able to plot all my linear regression plots.

VacationPy
With this part of the challenge i followed the templete given to use by the professor. 
I used help from Xpert Learning to plot my hvplot.
I received help from a tutor to make my for loop  work because i was receiving an error.
The tutor just told me to move my categories to my params and it fixed my issue. 
After that i just used the same formula as early to plot my graph again.
